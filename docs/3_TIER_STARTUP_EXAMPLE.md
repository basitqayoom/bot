## What Each Value Means

### Engine Configuration
- **0.4% SL**: Stop Loss at -0.4% (protects against large losses)
- **0.8% TP**: Take Profit at +0.8% (realistic 1m scalping target)
- **1m**: Trading on 1-minute candlesticks (high frequency)

### Tier 1: 0.5% Breakeven Lock
- **When**: Trade reaches +0.5% profit
- **Action**: Move stop loss to breakeven (entry price)
- **Purpose**: Guarantee no loss once trade shows profit
- **Example**: Buy BTC at $100,000
  - Profit reaches +0.5% ($100,500)
  - SL moves from $99,600 → $100,000 (breakeven)
  - Trade can no longer close at a loss

### Tier 2: 1.5% Partial Exit 50%
- **When**: Trade reaches +1.5% profit
- **Action**: Close 50% of position
- **Purpose**: Lock in profit before full TP
- **Example**: Buy $1,000 worth of ETH
  - Profit reaches +1.5% ($1,015)
  - Sell $500 worth (50%)
  - Lock $7.50 profit guaranteed
  - Let remaining $500 run to TP or trailing

### Tier 3: 300s Trailing (Locks 60%)
- **When**: Trade in profit for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Action**: Activate trailing stop that locks 60% of max profit
- **Purpose**: Follow winning trades and protect gains
- **Example**: Trade reaches +3% max profit ($1,030 on $1,000 position)
  - After 5 minutes, trailing activates
  - Locks 60% of +3% = +1.8% minimum ($1,018)
  - If price goes to +4%, lock moves to +2.4%
  - If price reverses, closes at locked level

## Real Trade Example

Let's see how all 3 tiers work together on a real trade:

### Initial Setup
- **Symbol**: BTCUSDT
- **Entry**: $100,000
- **Position Size**: $1,000
- **Original SL**: $99,600 (-0.4%)
- **Original TP**: $100,800 (+0.8%)

### Trade Timeline

**T+30 seconds: +0.5% profit**
```
Price: $100,500
Tier 1 ACTIVATED ✅
Action: SL moved to $100,000 (breakeven)
Status: Trade now risk-free
```

**T+2 minutes: +1.5% profit**
```
Price: $101,500
Tier 2 ACTIVATED ✅
Action: Close 50% of position ($500)
Profit Locked: $7.50
Remaining: $500 position
```

**T+6 minutes: +2.5% profit (max so far)**
```
Price: $102,500
Tier 3 ACTIVATED ✅
Action: Trailing stop locks 60% of +2.5% = +1.5%
Min Exit: $101,500 (guaranteed +$7.50 on remaining $500)
Total Locked: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00 profit minimum
```

**T+8 minutes: Price reverses to +1.6%**
```
Price: $101,600
Tier 3 TRIGGERS 🎯
Action: Close remaining 50% at $101,600
Final Profit: 
  - First 50%: +$7.50 (at $101,500)
  - Second 50%: +$8.00 (at $101,600)
  - TOTAL: +$15.50 (+1.55% on $1,000)
```

### Without 3-Tier System
Without protection, this trade could have:
- Reversed completely to SL: -$4.00 loss
- Or closed at TP: +$8.00 profit
- **Give-back**: Lost $17.50 of potential profit!

### With 3-Tier System
- **Actual Profit**: +$15.50
- **Give-back**: Only $10.00 (from max +$25.50)
- **Protection**: 61% give-back reduction
- **Peace of Mind**: Priceless 😌

## Quick Start

1. **Build the bot**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/basitqayoomchowdhary/Desktop/personal/project/bot
   go build -o bot .
   ```

2. **Run with verbose mode** (to see full display):
   ```bash
   ./bot
   # When prompted, enable verbose mode
   ```

3. **Watch for tier activations**:
   - Look for breakeven locks in trade logs
   - Monitor partial exits before TP
   - Track trailing stop behavior

4. **Collect results**:
   - Let bot run for 100+ trades
   - Compare with historical data
   - Check if give-back reduced
